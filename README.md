The JBoss Arquillian evaluation

This is a repository which provides the experimental, lesson learn and trouble shooting for evaluating
the JavaEE unit testing with JBoss Arquillian. It would be nice to have a shared small but completed 
example coding for any further communicating with the opensource community.

Basically, It is based on Apache Maven, JBoss Arquillian, Glassfish embedded, including with very nice
extensions, i.e. Weld, Hibernate validator, Seam Validation, Mojarra, Metro, Primefaces.

Please feel free and do not hesitate to join, fork, share or keep improving it.
